# hierarchicalPortfolios
Offers a set of functions for the design of portfolios using hierarchical
clustering, such as Lopez de Prado's (2015) hierarchical risk parity (HRP)
method, as well as the hierarchical equal risk contribution (HERC) method
proposed by Raffinot (2018). In addition, we provide some extensions the
original methods, such as: divisive clustering, a tuning parameter for HRP and
HERC, alternative risk measures (such as expected shortfall) for HERC, and
budget constraints on HRP.
