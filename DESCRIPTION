Title: Design of Hierarchical Clustering-Based Portfolios
Version: 0.1
Description: Offers a set of functions for the design of portfolios using
    hierarchical clustering, such as Lopez de Prado's (2015) hierarchical risk
    parity (HRP) method, as well as the hierarchical equal risk contribution
    (HERC) method proposed by Raffinot (2018). In addition, we provide some
    extensions the original methods, such as: divisive clustering, a tuning
    parameter for HRP and HERC, alternative risk measures (such as expected
    shortfall) for HERC, and budget constraints on HRP.
